Assignment1-IS1570 Create a 5 page website using only HTML CSS and JS from hand
The site is about the different clubs I am a part of. The main page lists the top 5 clubs I am in and goes in to a breif detail about what the club is about and what it does. CrossFit page talks about CrossFit, the pros, the cons, and then I rank different CrossFit movements. OASIS page talks about OASIS, pros, cons, and duties I have as the business manager. Triathlon Page talks about triathlon, the pros, the cons, and then I compare it to CrossFit. Adaptive Athletics page is also the chess page as there was not enough content for both to have an page each. It goe sover what they are and what I do as the founder of Adaptive Athletics and then there's a button to spawn a bear gif.
